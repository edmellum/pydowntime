# PyDowntime

Checks a list of websites to see if they are up.
If one is down an email is sent to the recievers set in the script.
A flatfile and JSON is used to store whether the site was down last time the
check was done so as to avoid spamming the email receivers.
Run this as a cron job at regular intervals.
Written quickly and dirty AKA functionally.
